          Red has become famous for channeling his anger and directing it at the
          green, egg-stealing pigs. despite his aloof demeanor, red has become a
          hero in the bird community, using his leadership skills to rally the
          entire flock of angry birds against their piggy rivals. To red,
          keeping the eggs safe is the highest priority-even if that means he
          has to maybe interact with others from time to time..

          Stella is very optimistic and lovely. A natural born leader, she is
          always ready to put a smile on everyone's face.The problem is that
          stella is way more optimistic than optimise itself! She struggles
          beyond her limits to solve a problem, sometimes making it even worse.
          Stella is very creative,capable of inverting absurd fun games with a
          simple sheet of paper..

          Chunk is the fastest bird on Bird Island-he thinks fast, talks fast
          and moves even faster. While his impulsive nature and endless
          commentary often lands him in hot water,fast. Chunk speaks without a
          filter, so you never know just what will come out, and he jumps from
          one through to the next without waiting for anyone to catch up..

          Terence is a big bird. He's also huge, enormous, gargantuan even.He
          may be large,but he is also quite sizable, physical speaking- not to
          mention hulking.Ok, he's a big boy. probably, no one knows for sure
          because he only speaks in low growls. Terence uses his heft to leave a
          path of destruction in his wake-just the kind of bird for the job,
          when the job is pounding pig.
